            <li>Javascript Heap reduced by 36%</li>
            <li>DOM Updated as Required <strong>in under 10ms</strong></li>
            <li>No flashes of events / No DOM 'Lockups'</li>
            <li>Flash on the same page made was no issue</li>
            <li>Reduced DOM Node Count by half (so about 1500 end of match)</li>
            <li>Never a left over event handler on changes</li>

        <p>end of oct/2014 (using react 0.12.2)</p>

        <ul>
            <li>every 15-30 seconds
                <ul>
                    <li>Ended up with 8 - reusable react components/parts to the widget (4~6 are used completely independently as another widget)</li>
                    <li></li>
                    <li>Overall used memory was down 36%</li>
                    <li>Memory used on updates reduced by up to 10 times (completed in under 10ms)</li>
                    <li>Attached dom eventlisteners were automatically cleaned up or updated on the fly</li>
                    <li>DOM elementes reduced drastically because we no longer required data attributes (which was a hack to start with)</li>
                    <li>As the match goes on, diff time was consistent throughout.</li>
                    <li></li>
                    <li>Events updated in the past were updated when we were told they updated (position x/y, etc.) without us doing anything</li>
                    <li>We kept the _exact_ same output on the screen.</li>
