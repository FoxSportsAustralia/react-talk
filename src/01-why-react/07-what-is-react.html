            React Real Quick for those that don't know what it is (from facebook):<br>
            JUST THE UI<br>
            Lots of people use React as the V in MVC. Since React makes no assumptions about the rest of your technology stack, it's easy to try it out on a small feature in an existing project.<br>
            <br>
            React abstracts away the DOM from you.<br>
            React implements one-way reactive data flow (vs two-way typical in most 'View' stacks)<br>
