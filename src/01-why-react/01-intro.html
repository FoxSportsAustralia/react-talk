            <li>This is match tracker</li>
            <li>One of 42 widgets. Highly legacy. Huge code duplication. Copy/paste.</li>
            <li>Original code base for all widgets 16k, single file (stash can only show the first 10k)</li>
            <li>Widget was designed to show events for football matches (fouls, penalty shots, yellow/red cards, shots, goals)</li>
            <li>Written in jQuery - polls events once every 15-30s</li>
            <li>Templates written in str concat</li>
        </ul>
