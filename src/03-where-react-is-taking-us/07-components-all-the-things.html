            <li>As developers, we should look towards patterns and adopting what is useful.</li>
            <li>We should be aiming to make one project with multiple repositories easily understandable and searchable all the way through.</li>
            <li>For example, the WordPress migration.</li>
            <li>At Fox Sports, we adopted the components pattern and are now using it across our projects and repositories.</li>
